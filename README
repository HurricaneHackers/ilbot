Ilbot
=====
Introduction
------------
This is an IRC logging bot, and a CGI web interface for showing the logs.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation can be found at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot

Installation
------------
To install these scripts on your system you need to

Create a database, you can use ilbot.sql for that if you use MySQL
Install all dependencies, among them are
        Bot::BasicBot
        Calendar::Simple
        Config::File
        CGI
        Date::Simple
        DBI
        CGI::Carp
        Encode::Guess
        HTML::Entities
        HTML::Template
        HTTP::Headers
        File::Slurp
        Regexp::Common
        Text::Table
        Cache::Cache
Modify all config files, hopefully they are self-explanatory. Be sure to leave the NO_CACHE = 1 directrive in cgi.conf for now.

Copy (or link) the files of the cgi/ directory to where your webserver can find them, and edit the colors hash to fit your needs.

Please be sure to to include the .htacess file, which is hidden in default UNIX directory listings.

Here is an example virtual host configuration file: http://moritz.faui2k3.org/tmp/irclog.perlgeek.de.conf

Be sure to password-protect the file spam.pl with a .htaccess file.

Edit cgi/footer.tmpl and insert your name and Homepage in the "Provided by..." sentence, and add your contact details (and delete mine, please).

Once you're happy with your setup, enable caching by deleting the NO_CACHE = 1 line from cgi.conf

Note that in production mode, pages are cached for performance reasons.

During the installation, you should have caching disabled (by
setting NO_CACHE = 1 in cgi.conf). Once you're confident with your setup,
remove that setting again.

WARNING: When upgrading from previous versions of ilbot, and if you haven't
done it yet, you might need to change the SQL schema by running the
update-sql-add-summary.sql SQL file against your database, like

  mysql yourdatabse < update-sql-add-summary.sql

This might take a while, depending on the size of your database. During that
time, the IRC logs won't work properly.
