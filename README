This is an IRC logging bot, and a CGI web interface for showing the logs.

The documentation can be found at http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot

Installation instructs are still sorely missing, sorry about that.

Note that in production mode, pages are cached for performance reason.
During the installation, you should have caching disabled (by
setting NO_CACHE = 1 in cgi.conf). Once you're confident with your setup,
remove that setting again.
